Companion is the name of the project which is \developed by our team. The system will include four interconnected parts which will be running concurrently. These parts are Location, calculator, OCR and Voice Recognition. They will wait commands from the user at the same time and be triggered if the command taken concerns them.
The aim of the system is not to develop to design a guide for all aspects of blind people’s lives. Instead, it is focused on specific aspects which are thought to be essential by the team.
The application will not require from the users any personal information to be inserted to the application. There will not be any login page or password requirements to use the application.
The main goal of this project is to develop an application mostly for the use of blind people and to get them involved in smart phone environment. For example, reading something in front of them using voice command like “Read” which turns on the camera and identifies the text and gives voice output on whatever’s written. The user will also be able to learn his current location through location component of the application.
